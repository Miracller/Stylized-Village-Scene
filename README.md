## Technical Details

 1. Overall
    
    This scene mainly contains the following parts:
    - Terrain
    - Buildings
    - Foliages
    - Waters
      
    Our artists used UE5 to edit the terrain and foliages parts, so I needed to use UE5 to export assets into fbx format and then imported into Unity. In this stage, I also used Blender to adjust assets.

    Then I arranged every asset to its coherent position and added suitable components (like the Mesh Renderer or C# scripts) in Unity.
